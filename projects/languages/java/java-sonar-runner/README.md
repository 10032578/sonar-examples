This example demonstrates how to analyse Java project with Sonar Runner.

Prerequisites
=============
*   Sonar 2.6 or higher
*   Sonar Runner 1.2 or higher
*   Make sure that the PMD rule 'JUnit assertions should include a message' is activated on your default profile to get violations on test files (or set a specific quality profile in the sonar-project.properties file).
